Education is important for a person, his family, and society. Today, we are living in a digital world, where education is essential for survival. Education makes us knowledgeable, develops skills, and makes us intelligent. Education paves the way toward a successful life. It prepares us for real-world challenges and improves our understanding of people and developments around us. Education is important for personal, social, and economic development. A well-educated person can significantly contribute to the economic growth and development of his family and society. Mahatma Gandhi said about the importance of education, 'Real education consists in drawing the best out of yourself. What better book can there be than the book of humanity?' Education is a silent and peaceful weapon that can bring success without harm. The power of education, knowledge, and ideas is more influential and enduring than the force or violence the sword represents.
Education empowers us by providing specialized knowledge, relevant skills, and critical thinking abilities. We are more likely to engage in constructive and positive activities when we understand things in our ways. Education can tell us what is important and what is not to live a successful and peaceful life. It shows the difference between love and hate. A society needs to have an educated populace so that people are informed and engaged in civic activities. Informed citizens contribute to the democratic process and are better equipped to address societal issues peacefully. Countries like Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, etc. have the largest number of educated people. This is why these countries are consecutively on top of the Literacy and Human Development Index charts. By becoming knowledgeable and developing skills, we can deal with real-world situations. Dealing with challenges is part of life and growth. The more challenges we face, the stronger our cognitive and creative thinking develops. For example, when we prepare for an exam, we are told to solve sample papers, mock tests and previous year's exam papers to adapt to the exam environment better. By doing so, we have already experienced the examination feeling and know we are stronger and more intelligent than before.
Education offers us career opportunities. An educated person is more likely to get better job offers than someone who is not educated. For someone who is looking for specialised and higher-paying jobs, higher levels of education can help them achieve success. Modern problems require modern solutions. Today, there are several global crises like climate change, pollution, health and safety issues, poverty and unemployment, biodiversity loss, terrorism, etc. It is very important to overcome these and many other global problems to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). Education is the only way that can help us achieve sustainable development goals.
Education makes us aware of regional and global issues and with enhanced knowledge, we will be able to come up with better and environmentally friendly solutions. Education has the power to change the world and make it a better and safer place for every living being. With improved knowledge, skills and social abilities, we can make informed decisions, participate actively in our communities, and contribute meaningfully to society.
Education is a key tool in the fight against poverty. It provides us with the skills needed for employment and economic participation, breaking the cycle of poverty across generations. A well-educated population is more likely to have access to better job opportunities and higher incomes.
A well-educated populace is very important for the smooth functioning of democratic societies. Education instils civic values, critical thinking, and a sense of responsibility, enabling us to actively participate in the democratic process and contribute to the development of just and accountable governments. Education serves as a beacon of hope. It promises a better future. It is a fundamental entitlement for every human being on Earth, and to withhold this right is morally wrong. The absence of education in young people is a significant detriment to humanity. As the world faces new challenges, we need to understand those challenges and come up with sustained solutions to make this world a better place.
